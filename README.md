Sample symfony project to learn more about symfony framework.

Using XAMPP stack as a platform.

Basic install/setup would be:

-clone this repo;

-move site folder to /xampp/htdocs/ folder;

-get composer (from https://getcomposer.org/ );

-use composer to install site dependencies;

-run xampp (apache module);

-access site at http://localhost/symfony-site/web/app_dev.php/index (as it's dev environment);

The base site address & path could further be changed within apache config to make site address more appealing.
